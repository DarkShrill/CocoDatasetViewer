Welcome to my COCO dataset test project! Here, I dedicate myself to exploring and analysing the famous COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset. With enthusiasm and curiosity, I use this image-rich dataset to select a specific image and represent the objects within it by means of squares surrounding them, according to their 'labels' or tags.
